# Week 1

## More class info

- In the beginning, every assignment and exercise has demo videos.
  - Work that is graded as *Exceptional* will be more than just following the demo and turning it in.

## About these meetings

- How these meetings will work
  - Meetings will be recorded (when I remember ðŸ˜…)
  - I will go over previous assignment and we can talk about what has come up.
  - Demonstrate new ideas and explain mental models as much as I can
  - Discuss exercises and assignments (often with demos)
- There are definitely redundancies with videos and readings later in the week. That is intentional. I want this session to be "Oh, this is _*what*_ I can do." and the demo videos and readings for you to think "Oh, this is _*how*_ I do it".
